# üöÄ Part 1: AWS Account Setup

## What We'll Accomplish in This Part

By the end of this tutorial, you will:
- ‚úÖ Have a working AWS account (your "cloud computer rental account")
- ‚úÖ Understand what AWS is and why we need it for our issue tracker
- ‚úÖ Know how to navigate the AWS Console (the control panel)
- ‚úÖ Have billing alerts set up to avoid surprise charges (like setting a spending limit)
- ‚úÖ Be ready to start building your issue tracking SaaS application

**‚è∞ Estimated Time: 45-60 minutes (about as long as watching a movie)**

## What is AWS? (Explained Like You're 13)

Imagine you want to start a lemonade stand, but instead of just selling lemonade, you want to create an app that helps people track their homework assignments. Here's the difference:

üè† **Traditional Way (Like setting up in your garage)**:
- You buy a computer and put it in your bedroom
- You install special software to run your app
- When more people want to use your app, you need to buy more computers
- If the power goes out at your house, your app stops working
- You have to fix everything yourself when it breaks

‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS Way (Like renting space in a massive tech mall)**:
- Amazon has HUGE buildings full of super-powerful computers
- You "rent" some computer power from them (like renting a booth in a mall)
- When more people use your app, Amazon automatically gives you more power
- If one computer breaks, Amazon fixes it and your app keeps working
- Amazon handles all the technical stuff, you focus on your issue tracker

### Why Use AWS for Our Issue Tracker?

Think of AWS like **the world's most advanced arcade**:

- **No Hardware Needed**: You don't need to buy expensive gaming machines (servers)
- **Pay As You Play**: Like putting quarters in arcade games - you only pay when people use your issue tracker
- **Never Breaks Down**: If one game breaks, there are backups ready instantly
- **Worldwide**: Your issue tracker can work fast anywhere in the world
- **Professional**: Real companies like Netflix, Spotify, and yes, even Jira use AWS!

## Step 1: Create Your AWS Account

### 1.1 Go to AWS Sign-Up Page

Think of this like creating an account for a really important online service:

1. **Open your web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - any will work)
2. **Go to**: https://aws.amazon.com
3. **Look for the orange button** that says **"Create an AWS Account"** (usually in the top right corner)
4. **Click it!**

### 1.2 Fill Out Account Information

You'll see a form asking for basic info. Think of this like signing up for a social media account, but for business:

**Root user email address**:
- Use an email you check regularly (like your main email, not a throwaway)
- This will be your "master key" to everything
- Example: `yourname@gmail.com`

**AWS account name**:
- Choose something that describes your issue tracker project
- Example: `MyIssueTrackerSaaS` or `JohnsProjectManager`
- Make it memorable - you'll see this name often!

**Password**:
- Make it REALLY strong (this protects everything!)
- Use at least 8 characters
- Include numbers, letters, and symbols
- Write it down somewhere SAFE (like a password manager)

Click **"Continue"** (like clicking "Next" in a game setup)

### 1.3 Contact Information

Fill out your real information - AWS needs to verify you're a real person (like when you sign up for a bank account):

**Account Type**: 
- Select **"Personal"** (unless you're doing this for a company)

**Personal Information**:
- **Full Name**: Your real name
- **Phone Number**: Your real phone (AWS might call to verify)
- **Country**: Where you live
- **Address**: Your real address

**Legal Agreement**:
- ‚úÖ **Check the box** to agree to AWS Customer Agreement (like agreeing to terms of service)

Click **"Continue"**

### 1.4 Payment Information

‚ö†Ô∏è **SUPER IMPORTANT**: AWS needs a credit card, but don't worry - we'll set up alerts so you don't get charged!

Think of this like putting a credit card on file at a store - they need it "just in case," but you won't actually buy anything expensive:

- **Enter your credit card information** (or ask a parent/guardian to help)
- AWS will charge **$1 temporarily** to make sure the card works (they give it back immediately)
- This is just to prove you're not a robot or scammer

**Why they need this**: Even though most of what we'll build is free, AWS wants to make sure you're a real person with a real payment method.

Click **"Continue"**

### 1.5 Identity Verification

AWS wants to make sure you're a real person (not a robot trying to hack things):

**Phone Verification**: 
1. **Enter your phone number** (the same one you used above)
2. **Choose "Text message (SMS)"** (easier than a phone call)
3. **Click "Send SMS"**

**Enter the Code**:
1. **Check your phone** for a text from AWS
2. **Type the 4-digit code** into the box on your computer
3. **Click "Continue"**

This is like when Instagram sends you a code to verify your account!

### 1.6 Choose Support Plan

You'll see different support plans - think of these like different levels of customer service:

- **Basic**: $0/month ‚úÖ **Choose this one!** (Like free customer service)
- **Developer**: $29/month (Like premium customer service - we don't need this)
- **Business**: $100/month (Like VIP customer service - definitely don't need this)

**Select "Basic support - Free"** and click **"Complete sign up"**

üéâ **Congratulations!** You now have your very own AWS account - it's like having your own account at the world's biggest computer rental company!

## Step 2: First Login to AWS Console

### 2.1 Access the AWS Console (Your Control Panel)

Think of the AWS Console like the control panel of a spaceship - it lets you control everything:

1. **Go to**: https://aws.amazon.com
2. **Click "Sign In to the Console"** (top right corner)
3. **Enter the email and password** you just created
4. **Click "Sign in"**

You should now see the **AWS Management Console** - this is like the cockpit where you'll build your issue tracker!

### 2.2 Understanding the AWS Console (Your Dashboard)

The AWS Console is like the dashboard of a really advanced video game:

**üîç Key Areas to Notice:**

1. **Search Bar** (top center): Type any service name here (like searching in YouTube)
2. **Services Menu** (top left): Click to see all available "tools" you can use
3. **Account Name** (top right): Shows you're logged into YOUR account
4. **Region Selector** (top right): ‚≠ê **SUPER IMPORTANT!** Shows which data center you're using

## Step 3: Set Up Your Region (Choose Your Server Location)

### 3.1 What is a Region? (Explained Simply)

AWS has massive computer warehouses all around the world. A "region" is like choosing which warehouse to use:

**Think of it like choosing a pizza delivery location**:
- If you live in New York and order from a California pizza place, it takes forever
- If you order from a local place, you get your pizza fast
- Same with AWS - choose the region closest to you for the fastest speeds!

### 3.2 Choose Your Region

1. **Look at the top-right corner** of your AWS Console
2. **You'll see something like "N. Virginia" or "Ohio"** - this is your current region
3. **Click on the region name** to see other options
4. **Choose a region based on your location:**

**üåé Recommended Regions (Choose the closest one):**

**If you're in the United States:**
- **East Coast**: US East (N. Virginia) - `us-east-1` ‚≠ê **BEST CHOICE**
- **West Coast**: US West (Oregon) - `us-west-2`
- **Texas area**: US East (Ohio) - `us-east-2`

**If you're in Europe:**
- **Europe**: Europe (Ireland) - `eu-west-1`

**If you're in Asia:**
- **Asia**: Asia Pacific (Singapore) - `ap-southeast-1`

**üí° Pro Tip**: If you're not sure, choose `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) - it has the most services and usually the lowest prices. It's like the "main headquarters" of AWS.

5. **Click your chosen region**

‚úÖ **Super Important**: Remember your region choice! We'll use the same region throughout this entire tutorial. It's like choosing a home base - don't change it later!

## Step 4: Set Up Billing Alerts (Super Important - Prevent Surprise Charges!)

This is **THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP** to avoid getting a big bill! Think of it like setting a spending limit on your phone or video game account:

### 4.1 Access Billing Dashboard

1. **Click your account name** in the top-right corner (where it shows your name)
2. **Click "Billing and Cost Management"** from the dropdown menu
3. This is like opening your "account balance" page

### 4.2 Enable Billing Alerts

1. **In the left sidebar**, click **"Billing preferences"**
2. **Scroll down** to find **"Alert preferences"**
3. **Check the box**: ‚úÖ **"Receive Billing Alerts"**
4. **Click "Save preferences"**

This is like turning on notifications for your bank account - you'll get emails if you start spending money.

### 4.3 Create a Billing Alarm (Your Safety Net)

This is like setting up a text alert that says "Hey, you're spending money!" before things get expensive:

1. **In the left sidebar**, click **"Budgets"**
2. **Click "Create budget"** (the big button)
3. **Select "Cost budget"** (we want to track spending)
4. **Click "Next"**

**Set Budget Details (Like setting your allowance limit):**
- **Budget name**: `My-Issue-Tracker-Budget`
- **Budget amount**: `$5.00` (or whatever you're comfortable with)
- **Time period**: `Monthly` (resets every month)
- **Start month**: Current month

**Click "Next"**

**Set up Alerts (Like setting phone notifications):**
- **Alert #1**: When actual cost exceeds `80%` of budget amount
  - This means: "Tell me when I've spent $4 out of my $5 budget"
- **Email recipients**: Enter your email address (where you want the warning sent)
- **Click "Next"**
- **Review everything** and click **"Create budget"**

üõ°Ô∏è **You're now protected!** AWS will email you if costs start adding up. It's like having a friend watch your spending and tap you on the shoulder when you're about to buy something expensive.

## Step 5: Explore Key AWS Services (Your Toolkit Tour)

Let's take a quick tour of the "tools" we'll use to build your issue tracker. Think of this like exploring a new video game and seeing what weapons and abilities are available:

### 5.1 Lambda (Your Code Runner)

1. **In the search bar**, type `Lambda`
2. **Click "Lambda"** from the results
3. You should see: "Welcome to AWS Lambda"

**What is Lambda? (Simple explanation)**:
Think of Lambda like having a **magical assistant** who does tasks for you:
- You write instructions (code) like "When someone creates an issue, save it to the database"
- AWS runs your instructions only when needed (like when someone clicks "Create Issue")
- You only pay when the assistant is actually working
- The assistant can handle 1 person or 1,000 people simultaneously
- Perfect for handling issue creation, user management, team assignments, etc.

### 5.2 DynamoDB (Your Super-Fast Filing Cabinet)

1. **In the search bar**, type `DynamoDB`
2. **Click "DynamoDB"** from the results
3. You should see the DynamoDB dashboard

**What is DynamoDB? (Simple explanation)**:
Think of DynamoDB like a **magical filing cabinet** that:
- Stores all your issue tracker data (issues, users, teams, comments)
- Finds any piece of information in milliseconds (faster than you can blink)
- Automatically makes copies of everything so nothing gets lost
- Can grow from storing 1 issue to storing millions of issues
- Never gets full or slows down

### 5.3 API Gateway (Your Traffic Director)

1. **In the search bar**, type `API Gateway`
2. **Click "API Gateway"** from the results
3. You should see: "Amazon API Gateway"

**What is API Gateway? (Simple explanation)**:
Think of API Gateway like a **smart receptionist** at a big company:
- When your website says "Create a new issue," the receptionist gets the message
- The receptionist checks if you're allowed to create issues (security)
- Then forwards your request to the right assistant (Lambda function)
- Brings the response back to your website
- Handles thousands of requests at once without getting confused

### 5.4 Cognito (Your Digital Bouncer)

1. **In the search bar**, type `Cognito`
2. **Click "Amazon Cognito"** from the results
3. You should see the Cognito dashboard

**What is Cognito? (Simple explanation)**:
Think of Cognito like a **super-smart bouncer** at an exclusive club:
- Manages the guest list (user accounts)
- Checks IDs at the door (login process)
- Gives wristbands to people who are allowed in (authentication tokens)
- Remembers who's a VIP (admin) vs regular guest (user)
- Handles password resets and keeps accounts secure
- Manages different companies (tenants) with separate guest lists

## Step 6: Understanding AWS Free Tier (Your Free Playground)

### 6.1 What is Free Tier? (Your Allowance)

AWS gives new accounts **12 months of free access** to many services! It's like getting free arcade tokens for a year:

### 6.2 Key Free Tier Limits for Our Issue Tracker:

| Service | Free Tier Allowance | What This Means for Your Issue Tracker |
|---------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Lambda** | 1 million requests/month | Your code can run 1 million times (that's A LOT of issues!) |
| **DynamoDB** | 25 GB storage | Store 25 GB of issues, users, comments (millions of issues) |
| **API Gateway** | 1 million API calls | Your website can talk to backend 1 million times |
| **Cognito** | 50,000 active users | 50,000 people can have accounts in your issue tracker |
| **S3** | 5 GB storage | Store 5 GB of file attachments |

**üí° Great News**: Our tutorial will use only a tiny fraction of these limits! You'd need thousands of users creating hundreds of issues per day to even come close to these limits.

### 6.3 Monitor Your Usage (Check Your "Allowance Balance")

1. **Go back to "Billing and Cost Management"**
2. **Click "Free Tier"** in the left sidebar
3. This shows how much of your free allowance you've used

Check this once a week to stay on track! It's like checking your phone's data usage.

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps (Let's Make Sure Everything Works!)

Let's test that everything is set up correctly. Think of this like doing a safety check before starting a car:

### Test 1: Can you access the AWS Console?
- [ ] Navigate to https://aws.amazon.com
- [ ] Sign in with your new account
- [ ] See the AWS Management Console dashboard
- ‚úÖ **Success**: You should see a page with lots of service icons and your account name in the top right

### Test 2: Is your region set correctly?
- [ ] Look at the top-right corner of your console
- [ ] See your chosen region (like "N. Virginia" or "Oregon")
- ‚úÖ **Success**: The region name should match what you selected

### Test 3: Are billing alerts active?
- [ ] Go to Billing and Cost Management
- [ ] Click "Budgets" in the sidebar
- [ ] See your budget listed (should be "My-Issue-Tracker-Budget")
- ‚úÖ **Success**: You should see your $5 budget with $0 spent so far

### Test 4: Can you access key services?
- [ ] Search for "Lambda" and open the service
- [ ] Search for "DynamoDB" and open the service
- [ ] Search for "API Gateway" and open the service
- [ ] Search for "Cognito" and open the service
- ‚úÖ **Success**: All services should open without errors

### Test 5: Free tier monitoring works
- [ ] Go to Billing ‚Üí Free Tier
- [ ] See your current usage (should be mostly empty for a new account)
- ‚úÖ **Success**: You should see all services at 0% or very low usage

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues (When Things Go Wrong)

### Issue 1: "Account is being activated"
**Problem**: AWS is still setting up your account (like processing a membership application)
**Solution**: Wait 10-15 minutes and try again. Sometimes AWS needs time to set everything up.

### Issue 2: Can't find a service
**Problem**: The service might not be available in your region (like a store that's not in your city)
**Solution**: 
1. Switch to `us-east-1` region (N. Virginia)
2. Try searching for the service again
3. This region has all services available

### Issue 3: Credit card declined
**Problem**: Your bank or credit card company blocked the transaction
**Solution**:
1. Call your bank and tell them you're signing up for AWS
2. Or try a different credit card
3. Some banks are extra careful with new tech companies

### Issue 4: Can't create billing alert
**Problem**: Billing alerts might take time to activate (like waiting for a new bank account to be ready)
**Solution**: Wait 30 minutes and try again. Sometimes AWS systems need time to sync up.

### Issue 5: Verification code not received
**Problem**: Phone verification text didn't arrive
**Solution**:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes (sometimes texts are slow)
2. Check that you entered your phone number correctly
3. Try "Call me now" instead of text message

## üéØ What We Accomplished (Victory Lap!)

Amazing work! You now have:
- ‚úÖ A fully functional AWS account (your own cloud computing account!)
- ‚úÖ Billing protection to prevent surprise charges (your financial safety net)
- ‚úÖ Understanding of key AWS services we'll use (your toolkit)
- ‚úÖ Proper region configuration (your home base)
- ‚úÖ Knowledge of AWS Free Tier limits (your allowance)

**You've just completed the hardest part** - getting started! Everything else builds on this foundation.

## üîú What's Next?

In **Part 2: Identity & Access Management**, we'll:
- Learn about AWS security (like setting up locks and keys for your issue tracker)
- Create special users and roles for different parts of your application
- Set up proper permissions (who can do what)
- Understand the principle of "least privilege" (only give people the keys they need)

Think of Part 2 like **setting up security for your issue tracker**:
- You (Root User) get the master key to everything
- Your issue tracker app gets specific keys for specific tasks
- User accounts get limited keys based on their role (User, Admin, Super Admin)
- We'll make sure hackers can't get in, but legitimate users can work smoothly

This might sound complicated, but think of it like setting up different levels of access in a video game - some players can only play, some can moderate, and some can manage the whole server.
